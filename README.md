# LinkSpector
LinkSpector is a C# project for checking the validity of links ion a given website. The console application automatically checks all links on a given website and reports the status of each link.

The project is inspired by [Lychee](https://lycheeorg.github.io/lychee/) that is written in Rust and created by awesome developers such as [Matthias Endler](https://github.com/mre).
